		<img src="images/PrimeCal.png" alt="Prime Calibration Screenshot" />
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>
		Recently a client required PC software for their new range of life science laboratory equipment. The software needed to accurately calibrate the temperature measurement of the equipment, automate a lengthy verification procedure and produce a printable calibration certificate.
		</p>
		<p>
		The software was written in C# 4.0 using Visual Studio 2013, the user interface was created using WPF to provide a stylish and professional look. MSI installers were created to distribute the software.

		To offer your customers a better user experience an embedded computer with a hi-resolution touch screen is required. Embedded software is written using modern tools such as Visual Studio, written in languages such as C# or Java and run on top of an operating system such as Windows CE, Linux or Android. An embedded application will typically communicate with the low-level electronics using an RS232 connection.

		<img src="images/Melting5.png" width="640" height="480" alt="Automatic Melting Point" />
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>
		The Stuart SMP40 is an advanced laboratory apparatus that uses a camera and image processing to determining the melting point of a chemical sample. The code was written in C# and runs on a Windows CE 5.0 embedded computer. The embedded app controls the camera, processes images, records the images as video and communicates to the low-level heater electronics.

		<h3>Case Study</h3>
		<br/>
		<img src="images/dri-block.jpg" alt="Dri-Block" />
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>
		A Dri-Block is a laboratory instrument providing a wide range of temperatures. The electronics uses a Platinum Resistance Thermometer with a 20 bit ADC that delivers precise temperature measurements. The temperature is controlled using a PID controller algorithm which has been tuned to deliver 
		a temperature stability within +/-0.1C.  Temperature is displayed on 5 multiplexed 7-seg displays and 4 touch buttons are used to program the device.
		</p>
		<p>
		The code was written in embedded C for a Microchip PIC microcontroller.
