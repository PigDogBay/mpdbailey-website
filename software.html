		Firmware is the software that runs on the electronics inside your product. The firmware performs functions such as displaying information on a LCD, handling button presses, controlling motors, measuring temperature and processing communications such as RS232 or USB. Our particular expertise is 
		with the Microchip PIC family of microcontrollers and we can offer help with your electronic design.
		</p>

		<h3>Case Study</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		The Techne Dri-Block is a laboratory instrument providing a wide range of temperatures. The electronics uses a Platinum Resistance Thermometer with a 20 bit ADC that delivers precise temperature measurements. The temperature is controlled using a PID controller algorithm which has been tuned to deliver 
		a temperature stability within +/-0.1C.

		<p>
		To offer your customers a better user experience an embedded computer with a hi-resolution touch screen is required. Embedded software is written using modern tools such as Visual Studio, written in languages such as C# or Java and run on top of an operating system such as Windows CE, Linux or Android. An embedded application will typically communicate with the low-level electronics using an RS232 connection.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Case Study</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		The Stuart SMP40 is an advanced laboratory apparatus that uses a camera and image processing to determining the melting point of a chemical sample. The code was written in C# and runs on a Windows CE 5.0 embedded computer. The embedded app controls the camera, processes images, records the images as video and communicates to the low-level heater electronics.

		For more complex products a PC application is the best way to interface with your equipment. Desktop Windows applications allow for rich user interfaces and can process huge amounts of information.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Case Study</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		Techne produce a range of Thermal Cyclers which are used within the medical industry to replicate DNA. Thermal cyclers require precise temperature measurement and so sophisticated temperature calibration is used during manufacture. PC software fully automates the lengthy calibration process, produces an audit and calibration certificate at the end.

		<p>
		Why not compliment your product with an Android App that allows users to upload results to their phone. By adding a wi-fi or bluetooth module to your product you can connect over the air to a phone or tablet.
