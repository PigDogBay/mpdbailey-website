		Our team has many years experience in the software and the science equipment industry. We believe in a test driven approach using the latest agile methodologies.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Agile Design</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
			We understand it can be hard to come up with a complete software specification so we believe the best approach is to split a project into smaller parts.
			The specification can then evolve as deliverables are made and you can measure progress of the project as a whole.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		Testing is incorporated into our development process which means that we deliver stable and robust code. The time taken to test a project at the end is greatly reduced as testing will have already been baked in.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Regular Dialogue</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		In order to keep a project on track and to your expectations we will make regular software updates and discuss them with you incase any changes are required.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Weekly Cycles</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>
		The process is as follows, discuss a particular piece of work, code it, test it, deliver it, get your feedback and make any changes or fix any bugs for the next release. Weekly cycles helps to keep a project focussed on the intended specification, well tested, measure progress, release stable builds to your customers and puts control into your hands.
